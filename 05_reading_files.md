Reading files
-----------------------------

**Files Types**
- There are two types of files
  - Binary files
  - Non-binary files (text files)
  
**Binary Files**

- Typically, binary files can store the same amount of data more efficiently than a text file.
- They are important, because they can be read from and written to quicker than a text file.
- Some data can't easily be represented by characters.
	- For example, the btyecode in a Java class or the machine language of an executable file.
	- Image files that have may pixels are more efficiently written via binary
	- Computer games woud slow to a crawl if they didn't utilize binary
- Not human readable typically, but most binary files aren't meant to be read by humans.
	- There are specialized files that can use hex dumps, etc to help inspect these files on the rare occasion they need to be inspected.
	- In Java, there are classes which can help read in binary files while converting back to human readible characters in an efficient manner. (More to come below on this).

**Text Files**
- Human readible, but store data less efficently than binary files typically.

**The File Class**
- The File class is an abstract representation of a file (including the file path)
  - There are four constructors, one of which is
    - `File(String filename)` where `filename` can include a path as part of the filename
  - Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html" target="blank">online documentation</a>
  - There are plenty of methods for getting information about a File: </br>
`exists`, `getName`, `getPath`, `canRead`, `canWrite`, `createNewFile`, `delete`, `length`

# File IO (Reading a text file)

Let's start with something simple. We want to read lines from a text file. The following is one way to do it utilizing pre-existing Java classes.

**The BufferedReader Class**
  - We create a `BufferedReader` object based on the name of the file that we want to read from
     - Here `file` is an actual file in the computer file system versus a `File` object
  - A `BufferedReader` has two things that we want to use
     - It has a method to read a line of text â€“ `readLine()`
     - And it buffers the input, so that reading from the file is efficient
  - The `BufferedReader` constructors requires a `Reader` argument
  - A `Reader` is an abstract class for reading from character streams
     - An abstract class is a class with the keyword abstract in its declaration. An abstract class cannot be instantiated. Classes can extend the abstract class, implementing any abstract methods.
  - Below is a couple of subclasses of `Reader`
     - `BufferedReader`
     - `CharArrayReader`
     - `FilterReader`
     - `InputStreamReader`
     - `PipedReader`
     - `StringReader`
 
 **The InputStreamReader Class**
  - We are going to use the `InputStreamReader`
     - An `InputStreamReader` can read bytes and convert them into characters
     - It has methods to read a single character or multiple characters into an char[]
     - The constructor requires an `InputStream`
  - An `InputStream` is an abstract class for representing an input stream of bytes
  - Below are some subclasses of `InputStream`
     - `AudioInputStream`
     - `ByteArrayInputStream`
     - `FileInputStream`
     - `FilterInputStream`
     - `ObjectInputStream`
     - `PipedInputStream`
     - `SequenceInputStream`
     - `StringBufferInputString`
  
  **The FileInputStream**
  - We will use the `FileInputStream`
  - A `FileInputStream` can read bytes from a file in a file system
  - There are constructors that take either a `File` or `String` to specify the file to read from
     - `FileInputStream(File file)`
     - `FileInputStream(String filename)`
  - `FileInputStream` has methods to
     - Read a single byte
     - Read multiple bytes into a byte array
     
 **Putting it All Together**
  - We now have everything that we need to instantiate our `BufferedReader`
  - Let `String` `filename` be the file that we want to read from
     - If the file is in the folder that you are executing your code from, then `filename` is just the name of the file
     - If the file is not in the folder that you are executing your code from, then `filename` needs to include enough path information for your program to find the file

  - We need to import these Java classes to leverage them.
  - To do so, we add the following at the top of our program:

```java  
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.FileInputStream;   
```

 - Then we construct a `BufferedReader` object to read `filename` as follows:

```java

BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filename)));
```

  - When writing code that involves reading a file, we need do so inside a try/catch block.
  	- What if the file doesn't exist?
  	- What if something goes wrong trying to read the contents of the file?
  	- Our program would crash in such cases without utilizng a try/catch block.
  	- If we give the program a filename that does not exist, the program will generate a `FileNotFoundException`
  	
  - With our `BufferedReader` object constructed, we can now use `input.readLine()` to read a line of text from the input file
  - `readLine()` returns `null` when the end of the file is reached.
  	- We leverage this fact to create our terminating condition of the while loop.

**Utilizing a try/catch block**
- Example (read the content of a file and output to `System.out`)
- Notice we need to close the `BufferedReader` object once we are done utilizing it.

```java
try {
  BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(
      new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(args[0])));
  String inn;
  while((inn = input.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(inn);
  }
  input.close();
} catch(Exception e) {
  System.out.println(e.toString());
  System.exit(1);
}
```

**Utilzing a try-with-resources block**
- Example (read the content of a file and output to `System.out`)
- Notice we do NOT need to explicitly close the `BufferedReader` object once we are done utilizing it.
- The try-with-resources block automatically closes the resource for us.

```java
try(BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(
      new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(args[0])))) {
  String inn;
  while((inn = input.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(inn);
  }
} catch(Exception e) {
  System.out.println(e.toString());
  System.exit(1);
}
```

**Alternative Approaches**
- We have looked at one way to read a text file, and there are other ways to do the equivalent
- We can also use the `Scanner` class to parse primitive types and Strings:
  - From a `File`
  - From an `InputStream`
  - From a `String`

# Parsing Text

Now that we can open up a text file, let's talk about how we can parse text and programmatically make sense of the data.

**The StringTokenizer Class**
- The `StringTokenizer` class can be used to break a `String` into individual tokens
- Example
    - `String testString = "abc xyz 012 lmn";`
    - Let's assume that the "tokens" or "data" are delimited by blank spaces, " ", in `testString`
     - We want to use the `StringTokenizer` class to break `testString` into the four tokens "abc", "xyz",  "012", and "lmn"
 - We can construct a `StringTokenizer` with the constructor `StringTokenizer(String stringInput)`, which defaults to using blank spaces, tabs ('\t'), newline ('\n'), carriage return ('\r'), and form feed character ('\f') as the delimiters
 - The `StringTokenizer` has methods to utilize:
    - `countTokens()`, how many tokens there are
    - `hasMoreTokens()`, if there are remaining tokens
    - `nextToken()`, return the next token

```java
String inn = new String("abc def ghi jkl");
java.util.StringTokenizer st = new java.util.StringTokenizer(inn);
while(st.hasMoreTokens()){
  String token = st.nextToken();
  // statements to process the current token
}
```

- In the loop `token` will take the values "abc" the first time through the loop, "def" the second, "ghi" the third, and "jkl" the fourth.
- You could use `st.countTokens()` above to allocate a String array to contain the tokens of `testString`
- Alternatively we could use the `String.split()` method or a `Scanner` to split the line of text
   - We'll discuss `Scanner` in the future
- `String.split(String regularExpression)` will return an array of Strings delimitted by a *regularExpression* pattern
- Example, spliting on white space:

```java
String inn = new String("abc def ghi jkl");
String[] tokens = inn.split("\\s+");
System.out.println("tokens = " + Arrays.toString(tokens));
```

OUTPUT
```
tokens = [abc, def, ghi, jkl]
```

# Example program for Reading / Parsing a text file

The following resides in supplemenary examples: `ReadTextFileAndParseTokensExample.java`

- We want to
  - Create a `BufferedReader` for the first command-line argument
  - Read the lines of text from the buffered reader
  - For each line of text, parse out the tokens, delimitted by blank spaces
  - Print each line of text to the screen/console
  - Print each token of the current line of text, indent with a tab
  - Exit if there is no command-line argument
  - Catch any exceptions that might be generated while instantiating or processing the `BufferedReader`

**ReadTextFileAndParseTokensExample.java**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;       // importing the necessary classes
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

class ReadTextFileAndParseTokensExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		if(args.length != 1) {  // check the command line has a single argument
			System.out.println("format is: ReadTextFileAndParseTokensExample \"input file name\"");
			System.exit(0);
		}

		try	{
			BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(
          new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(args[0])));
			String inn;
			while((inn = input.readLine()) != null) {    // read a line
				StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(inn);  
				System.out.println(inn + " (" + st.countTokens() + ")"); // print it
				while(st.hasMoreTokens()) {    // go through the tokens in the line
					String s = st.nextToken();
					System.out.println("\t" + s);
				}
			}
			input.close();
		} catch(Exception e) {  // if any exceptions, write a message
			System.out.println(e.toString());
			System.exit(1);
		}
	}
}
