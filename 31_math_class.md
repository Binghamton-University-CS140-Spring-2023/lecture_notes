The Math Class
----------------

- We haven't used it, but it has the basic mathematical operations that are expected in a math library.

| Method   | Description |
| ------   | ----------- |
| abs      | absolute value |
| acos     | arc cosine |
| asin     | arc sine |
| atan     | arc tangent |
| atan2    | arc tangent, too many words to describe here |
| ceil     | ceiling, smallest integer greater than or equal to |
| cos      | cosine |
| exp      | e, Euler number, raised to the value |
| floor    | floor, largest integer less than or equal to |
| log      | log base e |
| log10    | log base 10  |
| max      | returns maximum value |
| min      | returns minimum value |
| pow      | power  |
| random   | pseudo random number in [0.0, 1.0) |
| round    | rounds value |
| sin      | sine  |
| sinh     | hyperbolic sine |
| sqrt     | square root |
| tan      | tangent |
| tanh     | hyperbolic tangent |
| toDegrees| convert radians to degrees |
| toRadians| convert degrees to radians |

- That's not all of them, but the ones that are commonly used.
