Enumerations
-------------

- The `enum` type is a data type that allows a variable to be set to one of a ***set of predefined constant values***

## [The following is from the Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html)
- "You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants. That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and data sets where you know all possible values at compile timeâ€”for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, and so on."

## Simple Example

``` java
public enum DaysOfWeek 
{
	SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
```

## More impressive example

``` java

class sampleEnumDaysOfWeek
{
	public enum DaysOfWeek
	{
		SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
	}
	
	public enum DaysOfWeekEnhanced
	{
		SUNDAY ("Sunday", "sunday"), 
		MONDAY ("Monday", "monday"), 
		TUESDAY ("Tuesday", "tuesday"), 
		WEDNESDAY ("Wednesday", "wednesday"), 
		THURSDAY ("Thursday", "thursday"), 
		FRIDAY ("Friday", "friday"), 
		SATURDAY ("Saturday", "saturday");
		
		private final String dayCapitalized;
		private final String dayLowerCase;
		
		DaysOfWeekEnhanced(String dayCapitalized, String dayLowerCase)
		{
			this.dayCapitalized = dayCapitalized;
			this.dayLowerCase = dayLowerCase;
		}
		
		private String dayCapitalized()
		{
			return dayCapitalized;
		}
		
		private String dayLowerCase()
		{
			return dayLowerCase;
		}
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		DaysOfWeek dayOfWeek = null;
		DaysOfWeekEnhanced dayOfWeek2 = null;
		
		if( args.length > 0 )
		{
			if( args[0].equals("1") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.SUNDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.SUNDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("2") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.MONDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.MONDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("3") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.TUESDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.TUESDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("4") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.WEDNESDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.WEDNESDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("5") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.THURSDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.THURSDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("6") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.FRIDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.FRIDAY;
			}
			
			if( args[0].equals("7") )
			{
				dayOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.SATURDAY;
				dayOfWeek2 = DaysOfWeekEnhanced.SATURDAY;
			}
			
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.SUNDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.MONDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.TUESDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.WEDNESDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.THURSDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.FRIDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
		
		if( dayOfWeek == DaysOfWeek.SATURDAY )
		{
			System.out.println("day is " + dayOfWeek + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayCapitalized() + " " + dayOfWeek2.dayLowerCase());
		}
	}
