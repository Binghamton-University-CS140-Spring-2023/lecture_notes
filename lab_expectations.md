Lab Expectations
-----------------

- Last semester, Professor Garssion and I noticed that students seem to be struggling in labs.
- We are expecting a higher percentage of people completing labs the same day they are made public
- There may be some ways you can better prepare each week 

**Minimum Course Expectations**

- This is what we are excepting everyone to be doing:

1. Attending the lectures and labs (4.5 hours per week)
2. Reading the book (maybe an hour or so per week)
3. Reviewing the slides as needed (maybe a couple of hours per week)
4. Reviewing the sample programs as needed (maybe a couple of hours per week)
5. Working on the programming assignments (2 - 5 hours per week)

- **NOTE:** Attending lecture and labs is just the base expectation. It is not going to be enough for you to do well in the course. What you get out of it will be based on the level of effort you put into it.

**Example for lab 2 (prior to lab)**

1. Be prepared to read from text files and write to text file (sample code and notes)
2. Be prepared to read from binary files (sample code and notes)
3. Be prepared to write to DataOutputStream (sample code and notes)
4. You can copy and paste from the sample code if you want to, or alter any skeleton code provided within the github repo and utilize it as your own.
