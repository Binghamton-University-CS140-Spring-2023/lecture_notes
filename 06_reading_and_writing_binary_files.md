**Reading and writing binary files**
- Classes of interest
  - `FileInputStream`
    - Reads bytes from a file
    - Can construct with a `File` object or a `String` filename
  - `FileOutputStream`
    - writes bytes to a file
    - Can construct with a `File` object or a `String` filename
    - Can open to *append* to an existing file
  - `BufferedInputStream`
    - Adds a buffer to an input stream
  - `BufferedOutputStream`
    - Adds a buffer to an output stream
**Reading binary files**
- `FileInputStream`
  - Use either the `File file` constructor or the `String filename` constructor to create
  - Example
     - `java.io.FileInputStream input = new java.io.FileInputStream(args[0]);`
     - where `args[0]` is the filename from the command-line
  - Once you have the `FileInputStream`
     - Read single byte
     - Read multiple bytes into a byte array
     - Skip over multiple bytes of the input
  - Reading a single byte at a time is quite slow
  - Creating a `byte` array buffer to store multiple bytes at a time is significantly more time efficient
- `BufferedInputStream`
  - Use either the `InputStream` constructor or the `InputStream, buffer size` constructor to create
     - `FileInputStream` is an `InputStream`, so the following works
     - `java.io.BufferedInputStream input = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.BufferedInputStream(new java.io.FileInputStream(args[0]));`
     - `java.io.BufferedInputStream input = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.BufferedInputStream(new java.io.FileInputStream(args[0]), bufferSize);`
     - where `args[0]` is a filename and bufferSize is an `int`
  - Once you have the `BufferedInputStream`
       - Read single byte
       - Read multiple bytes into a byte array
       - Skip over multiple bytes of the input
  - Reading a single byte at a time is still slower than reading multiple bytes at a time into an array, but the `BufferedInputStream` is still much faster than `FileInputStream` reading a single byte at a time
**Writing binary files**
- `FileOutputStream`
  - Use either the `File file` constructor or the `String filename` to create
    - Can also include an optional `boolean` if you want to *append* to an existing file
  - Example
     - `java.io.FileOutputStream input = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.FileOutputStream(args[0]);`
     - `java.io.FileOutputStream input = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.FileOutputStream(args[0], true);`
     - where `args[0]` is filename and `true` says to *append* to the file
  - Once you have the `FileOutputStream`
     - Write  single byte
     - Write multiple bytes into a byte array
  - Writing a single byte at a time is quite slow
  - Creating a byte array buffer to write multiple bytes at a time is significantly more time efficient
- `BufferedOutputStream`
  - Use either the `OutputStream` constructor or the `OutputStream, buffer size` constructor to create
      - `FileOutputStream` is an `OutputStream`
  - Example
      - `java.io.BufferedOutputStream output = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.BufferedOutputStream(new java.io.FileOutputStream(args[2]));`
      - `java.io.BufferedOutputStream output = `<br/>&nbsp;`new java.io.BufferedOutputStream(new java.io.FileOutputStream(args[2]), bufferSize);`
      - where `args[2]` is the filename to write to and bufferSize is the size of the buffer to use
  - Once you have the `BufferedOutputStream`
      - Write single byte
      - Write multiple bytes from a byte array
  - Writing a single byte at a time is still slower than writing multiple bytes at a time from an array, but the` BufferedOutputStream` is still much faster than `FileOutputStream` writing a single byte at a time
